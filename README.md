# Fontamental

Fontamental, is a python library to extract the Fundamental glyphs of font, in a small abstract font, which can use in the re-production of the original font in new ways and weights.

The abstract font format and glyph names are inspired by the project of "Ali Uni font", and the "Mada" project by Khaled Hosni.

Goal in the first stage is to cover the entire Arabic glyphs range in the unicode standard.
